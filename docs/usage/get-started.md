# Get Started

Thank you for using our theme!

To set up the theme exactly like our demo stores, you may need to install our free app **[PapaThemes Widgets](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/papathemes-widgets/)**. This app provides additional widgets to visually build content in Page Builder without requiring coding skills.

To display your Instagram photos on your website, you can use our free tool **[PapaThemes Instagram](https://instagram.papathemes.com/)**. We will guide you step by step later in this manual.
